# Programmers Daily Routines

Today i wondered:

If Guitar Players have Practice Routines which they can do every day to get better.
Can Programmers have something like that too or is programming too complex and is 
using different kind of mental skills that simple exercises can't be applied to this profession?

Well.. YES!

While researching the Topic i discovered this page: http://codekata.com/

And it seems like it is a thing!

There is also the possiblity to integrate Coding Challanges like:

But everything seems kinda chaotic to me. Not structured enough. Too scattered.

Learning something is more than doing some random Tasks, Quizes or Challanges.

I have discovered that having an App that keeps me at learning something everyday enables me 
to get a given Topic way better than without having a given App. 

Duolingo is such an Example.

I wanted to learn fourth Language, but never had the motivation to do so. I have tried Spanish and Russian 
before but after a week or two i didn't have the motiviation to keep doing it. 

Enter, Duolingo. 

I have tried Duolingo before. Like in the year 2013 or 2014, but i didn't enjoyed it back than. 
Some months ago i had this Idea for an App. Duolingo, but for Programming, but i didn't knew exactly, how do i want do tackle this Problem exactly?
