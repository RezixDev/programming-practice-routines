# Programmers Daily Routines

Today i wondered:

If Guitar Players have Practice Routines which they can do every day to get better.
Can Programmers have something like that too or is programming too complex and is 
using different kind of mental skills that simple exercises can't be applied to this profession?

Well.. YES!

While researching the Topic i discovered this page: http://codekata.com/

And it seems like it is a thing!

There is also the possiblity to integrate Coding Challanges like:

But everything seems kinda chaotic to me. Not structured enough. Too scattered.

Learning something is more than doing some random Tasks, Quizes or Challanges.

I have discovered that having an App that keeps me at learning something everyday enables me 
to get a given Topic way better than without having a given App. 

Duolingo is such an Example.

I wanted to learn fourth Language, but never had the motivation to do so. I have tried Spanish and Russian 
before but after a week or two i didn't had the motiviation to keep doing it. 

Enter, Duolingo. 

I have tried Duolingo before. Like in the year 2013 or 2014, but i didn't enjoyed it back then. 
Some months ago i had this Idea for an App. Duolingo, but for Programming, but i didn't knew exactly, how do i want do tackle this Problem?

Should that be in form of Guides, how to programm using JavaScript or React? And than some Quizes testing your knowledge?

Would there be an Desktop + Mobile App or just Desktop or just Mobile?

I knew myself. Desktop App wouldn't keep me at learning French. I would forgot it. 
My Phone is with me almost at all times... seeing angry Duo telling me that i forgot to take my daily lesson is motivation enought to do the lesson.

it's just 5 minutes. Just, and yet that much. Because the habit of learning French really makes me Understand French everyday more. 

I guess having an well Designed App for learning Programming would be a great tool too. 

Because it's not only about the Lessons or the content. The Structure and Explaination of the Concepts matters too!

I could imagine quick lessons or quick strips of knowledge which are easy to understand with some Quizes at the End. 

Different kinds of Tasks which would take 5 to 15 minutes to Complete. 

I wonder if it would be possible to keep the lessons Short. The magic of Duoling is that sometimes, you are able to finish them in 2-3 Minutes if you undesrant a given Topic well. Having something like that in Programming World would be great.
